        "Use relaxation techniques to manage stress or racing thoughts that interfere with sleep&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:102]{index=102}. Try deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, or guided imagery when you get into bed&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:103]{index=103}. For example, you can inhale slowly for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds, focusing on the breath. Alternatively, visualize a peaceful scene (like being on a calm beach) to take your mind off worries. Some people find listening to a sleep meditation or nature sounds helpful.",
        "If you can’t fall asleep within ~20 minutes or you wake up and can’t drift back to sleep, get out of bed and do a quiet activity in low light&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:104]{index=104}. For instance, go to another room and read a dull book or listen to soft music. Avoid bright screens. Return to bed only when you feel sleepy again. This prevents you from tossing and turning anxiously. Also, limiting daytime naps to no more than 30 minutes and not too late in the day will help ensure you’re sleepy at night&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:105]{index=105}."

        "Melatonin supplement – a synthetic form of the hormone your body uses to regulate sleep. Taking an OTC melatonin pill (~3 mg to 5 mg) about 30-60 minutes before bedtime can help induce sleep, especially if your sleep cycle has been disrupted&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:106]{index=106}. Melatonin is generally safe and causes less morning drowsiness than typical sleep medications. (It’s wise to discuss the appropriate dose with your doctor.)",
        "Over-the-counter sleep aids containing antihistamines can be used occasionally for short-term insomnia. Examples include diphenhydramine (the ingredient in Benadryl® and ZzzQuil®) and doxylamine (Unisom®)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:107]{index=107}. These can make you drowsy and help you fall asleep, but be aware they can cause grogginess the next day and, with regular use, may lose effectiveness. Use them sparingly and follow the product instructions. If you are an older adult, use caution as these can cause confusion or dizziness in some people&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:108]{index=108}.",
        "Herbal supplements for sleep: Some people try valerian root, chamomile, or passionflower, which are available in teas or pill form. Valerian (often taken ~400-600 mg at bedtime) has mild sedative effects for some individuals, and chamomile tea before bed is a popular remedy for relaxation. Evidence for their effectiveness is mixed, but they are low-risk. Ensure your healthcare team knows about any herbs you take, as even natural supplements can interact with medications.",
        "Magnesium supplements or Epsom salt baths: Magnesium is a mineral that can promote muscle relaxation and healthy sleep. An Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) bath in warm water in the evening can relax muscles and calm the mind, potentially improving sleep onset. Alternatively, if your magnesium level is low, a magnesium glycinate supplement at night might help (consult your doctor for the appropriate dose). Do not exceed recommended doses, as too much magnesium can cause side effects.",
        "If pain or discomfort is keeping you awake, using appropriate OTC remedies can indirectly improve sleep. For example, if you have mild pain, a dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen in the evening (if approved by your doctor) can reduce pain enough to let you fall asleep more easily. Similarly, treating heartburn with an OTC antacid or acid reducer, or using an anti-nausea remedy if you feel queasy, can remove those barriers to sleep. Always address the root cause of insomnia symptoms with the appropriate OTC aid."
